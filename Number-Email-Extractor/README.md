# Phone Number and Email Address Extractor
#### Creating a program that extracts phone numbers and email addresses from text copied to the clipboard.

----

## Text Handling:
### The program should be able to perform the following tasks:
  + **Retrieve the text from the clipboard**
  + **Search for phone numbers and email addresses within the text**
  + **Paste the extracted phone numbers and email addresses back onto the clipboard**

## Logic and Operations:
- **Use the pyperclip module to handle clipboard operations (copy and paste)**
- **Create two regular expressions: one for detecting phone numbers and the other for detecting email addresses**
- **Ensure the program finds all matches, not just the first one**
